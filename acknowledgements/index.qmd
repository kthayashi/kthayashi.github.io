- The official [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/) and Sam Csik's [tutorial on creating Quarto websites](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/creating-quarto-websites/) were both very helpful for getting started building this website.
- The format of the [Publications](/publications) page was inspired by [Drew Dimmery's setup](https://ddimmery.com/posts/quarto-website/) and the [Wowchemy Hugo Academic Theme](https://github.com/wowchemy/starter-hugo-academic).
