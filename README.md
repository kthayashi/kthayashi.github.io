## Acknowledgments

- The official [Quarto guide](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/) and Sam Csik's [tutorial](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/creating-quarto-websites/) on creating a website using Quarto were both very helpful for getting started building this website.
- The format of the Publications page was inspired by [Drew Dimmery's setup](https://ddimmery.com/posts/quarto-website/) and the [Wowchemy Hugo Academic Theme](https://github.com/wowchemy/starter-hugo-academic).
